a) 
    Num2 = 0
    Num3 = Num1
    
    while Num3 != 0:
      Num2 += Num1
      Num3 -= 1
      
b)
  This is because, for each loop the value in s2 is increased by the value in s1. This has the effect of multiplying s2 by s1, s0 times.

c)
    Num0 = 10
    Num1 = 1
    Num2 = 0
    Num3 = Num0
    while Num0 != 0:
      Num2 = 0
      Num3 = Num0
      while Num3 != 0:
        Num2 = Num1
        Num3 -= 1
      Num1 += Num2
      Num0 -= 1
   
  

  
d)
 At the start of the file Num3 = Num0 so they both = 10. The inner loop then does 10 times 1. This makes Num2 = 10 after the first 
 iteration. After this Num1 is set to be equal to Num2 so both equal 10. After this first iteration Num0 is setto 9. Then the 
 inner loop does 9 times 10. Thissets Num2 to equal 90 and sets Num1 to equal the same value and sets Num3 to equal 8. This process 
 continues in teh same manner until Num0 = 0. 
 
e)
  addi $s0, $zero, 10
  addi $s1, $zero, 1

  inner: mult $s1, $s0
  mflo $s1
  addi $s0, $s0, -1
  bne $s0, $zero, inner
